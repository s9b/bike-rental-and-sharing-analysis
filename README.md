# bike-rental-and-sharing-analysis
Dataset Information
Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. Through these systems, users can easily rent a bike from a specific location and return it at another. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Opposed to other transport services, such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature converts the bike-sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be utilised for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that the most important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
